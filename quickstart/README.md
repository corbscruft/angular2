What have we done?
------------------

Our first application doesn't do much. It's basically "Hello, World" for Angular 2.

We kept it simple in our first pass: we wrote a little Angular component, we added some JavaScript libraries to index.html, and launched with a static file server. That's about all we'd expect to do for a "Hello, World" app.

We have greater ambitions
-------------------------

We won't ask Angular to build "Hello, World". We are asking it to help us build sophisticated applications with sophisticated requirements.

So we made some strategic technology investments to reach our larger goals

* our application loads faster with libraries installed locally and we can develop offline if we wish.
* we're pre-compiling our TypeScript.
* we're running the compiler and live-server with commands that give us immediate feedback as we make changes.

The good news is that the overhead of setup is (mostly) behind us. We're about to build a small application that demonstrates the great things we can build with Angular 2
